# How-should-couples-select-the-best-fertility-clinic-in-Ahmedabad-

Choosing a clinic involves checking medical expertise (qualified reproductive specialists), lab standards (IVF lab accreditation, embryologist experience), success rate transparency (age-stratified outcomes), available services (ICSI, PGT, donor programs, surrogacy if needed), supportive care (counseling, nutrition), and clear cost breakdowns. Visit the clinic, ask about patient flow, technology (incubators, culture media), embryo handling, and follow-up processes. Read patient reviews but verify via consultations. A good clinic balances strong clinical outcomes with individualized care, clear communication and ethical practices. Ensure you get a written treatment plan and cost estimate.
